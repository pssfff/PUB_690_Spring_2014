covariance = same number of data points for two variables
           = units? unit of x * unit of y
cov(xy) = E[xy - x(uy) - (ux)y+ (ux)(uy)] = E(xy) - (ux)(y)

correlation = unitless

beta zero : x0 -> 1 (assumed) 
y = beta * x0 + beta_1 * x1 = beta + beta_1*x1

predicted y value when x = 0 -> beta zero (B0)
B0 = zero -> strong constraint 

E(yIx=k) - E(yIx=k-1) = B1 (slope, expected change in y for increase in a 1-unit of x)

Least squares estimation : partial derivative of RSS(u(y)) by (u(y))
- how can we find the sample mean that minimizes the sumf of squared deviations
  - derivative of RSS in terms of 
  - when the derivative=0, the minimum point => sample mean can minimize
